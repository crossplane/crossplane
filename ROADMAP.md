# Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.
