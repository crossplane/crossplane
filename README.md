Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Compute Foundation][cncf] project.
