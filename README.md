Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane's [Get Started Docs] cover install and cloud provider quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.
