Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes without
needing to write code. It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to
build a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no
matter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in
control of the schema of the declarative API it offers.

Crossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.

## Get Started

Crossplane's [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues
added to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the
community, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.

The maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify
features and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The
community is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by
adding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the
[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.

The maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to
demand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at
any time.

Milestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of
overall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered
approximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific
delivery timeline.

### Special Interest Groups (SIG)

The Crossplane project supports SIGs as discussion groups that bring together
community members with shared interests. SIGs have no decision making authority
or ownership responsibilities. They serve purely as collaborative forums for
community discussion.

If you're interested in any of the areas below, consider joining the discussion
in their Slack channels. To propose a new SIG that isn't represented, reach out
through any of the contact methods in the [get involved] section.

Each SIG collaborates primarily in Slack, and some groups hold regular meetings
that you can find in the [Community Calendar][community calendar].
