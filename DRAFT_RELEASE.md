* **BREAKING CHANGE**: We [removed the in-tree Vault support](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/4503) for External Secret Stores, which was deprecated since [v1.12](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases/tag/v1.12.0) release. Follow [the latest guide](https://docs.crossplane.io/knowledge-base/integrations/vault-as-secret-store/) for using the Plugin approach instead.
