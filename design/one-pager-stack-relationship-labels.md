# Stack Parent/Child Relationship Label Spec

- Owner: Steven Rathbauer ([@rathpc](https://github.com/rathpc))
- Reviewers: Crossplane Maintainers
- Status: Draft

**_NOTE: The focus for this design is long term and may not be implemented immediately_**

## Proposal

[crossplane/crossplane#752](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/issues/752)

#### These are the labels we are proposing to add:

- **`core.crossplane.io/parent-group`**
- **`core.crossplane.io/parent-version`**
- **`core.crossplane.io/parent-kind`**
- **`core.crossplane.io/parent-name`**
- **`core.crossplane.io/parent-namespace`**

## Problem

There is currently no easy way to get a list of all resources that are owned by a parent resource.
We can leverage CRD labels to make this easier, as long as we have a standard format for doing so.
Additionally as long as we define this label on all children CRD's, we should then be able to query
all children of a given parent object using those labels.

Per the proposal, it seems that the closest example of what I am referring to is shown on
[this page][common-labels] within the `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` label. However since we are not
exactly using these labels for the intentions defined within that page, we should use something
following those patterns instead.

We had discussed using the _common labels_ as they are defined however after some deliberation we
decided the best course of action was to make our own. _<sup>[Additional Context &rarr;](#additionalContext)</sup>_

The primary reason for this was stated on [that page][common-labels]:

> ### _The metadata is organized around the concept of an application._

## Design

The group, version, and kind is captured as three individual fields to provide the most flexibility
for consumers of this metadata. Since consumers will have access to all 3 fields, they can on-demand
build any of the numerous GVK related formats available in the ecosystem. It was initially
considered to combine the group and version in the typical format of `my.group/v1alpha1`, but labels
cannot contain any slash characters. Therefore, storing the group, version, and kind as separate
fields seems reasonable.

Essentially, because the labels are organized around the concept of an application, they do not
really fit our concept of tracing multiple levels of parent/child relationships. Consider
[the label descriptions][common-labels]. They are missing the concept of a hierarchy like what we're
trying to build. The label which comes the closest is `part-of`, which reads `The name of a higher
level application this one is part of` (example: `wordpress`). None of the other labels are for
describing a hierarchical relationship.

Let's make things more concrete with an example. We **could use** `part-of` and/or `instance` to
point to parents if we wanted to. But this is not ideal. Consider the following example hierarchy,
where `A -> B` means A is a parent of B:

```text
WordpressInstance -> KubernetesCluster -> KubernetesApplication -> KubernetesApplicationResource
```

Semantically, the `app.kubernetes.io` labels _"are organized around the concept of an application"_.
Since the resources in the example hierarchy are all part of the same application (Wordpress), they
should all have the same `instance` and `part-of` labels:

```yaml
# WordpressInstance labels
app.kubernetes.io/name: wordpress
app.kubernetes.io/instance: wordpress-instance-efafe342
app.kubernetes.io/component: application-claim
app.kubernetes.io/part-of: wordpress

# KubernetesCluster labels
app.kubernetes.io/name: kubernetes
app.kubernetes.io/instance: wordpress-instance-efafe342
app.kubernetes.io/component: cluster
app.kubernetes.io/part-of: wordpress

# KubernetesApplication labels
app.kubernetes.io/name: kubernetes-application
app.kubernetes.io/instance: wordpress-instance-efafe342
app.kubernetes.io/component: workload
app.kubernetes.io/part-of: wordpress

# KubernetesApplicationResource labels
app.kubernetes.io/name: kubernetes-resource
app.kubernetes.io/instance: wordpress-instance-efafe342
app.kubernetes.io/component: workload-resource
app.kubernetes.io/part-of: wordpress
```

However, what we want is for each one to point back one step in the hierarchy. And that would
contradict organizing the labels around an application. The `app.kubernetes.io` labels are still
useful, just not for describing a multi-level hierarchy.
