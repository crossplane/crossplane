# Upbound `ui-schema.yaml` Specification

* Owner: Steven Rathbauer ([@rathpc](https://github.com/rathpc))
* Reviewers: Upbound Maintainers, Crossplane Maintainers
* Status: Accepted, revision 1.1

## Revisions

* 1.1 - Dan Mangum (@hasheddan)
  * Removed references to `version` field in `ui-schema.yaml` required fields.

## Terms

* **Stack**: A Stack is a Crossplane stack-manager managed package. These packages may bundle one or many Crossplane
applications or infrastructure provider controllers.
* **Stacks**: Stacks could refer to more than one Crossplane stack-manager packages or the Stack-Manager system as a whole.

See the [Stacks Design Doc](design-doc-packages.md) for more details about Crossplane Stacks.

## Objective

This document outlines one specific implementation of the `ui-schema.yaml` file that is meant to serve as a helpful
reference to other potential implementors in the future. This specification is driven by what is currently supported via
the Upbound GUI and meant to be used as the ground work for further UI development using this file.

## Proposed File format

OpenAPI v3

## Supported Fields

### Required Fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
`configSections` | An array of sections to display during the configuration of a resource. Each section should contain a `title` field, `items` field and optionally a `description` field.<br /><br />`title`: A string that labels the section.<br />`description`: A string which optionally provides additional details, instructions or context around the section.<br />`items`: An array of item objects to display within the section. [See below for details on currently supported items](#supportedItems).

### Optional Fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
`initialConfig` | A boolean **or** an object containing two optional fields (`order`, `required`) which instructs the UI to include this resource in the initial configuration step.<br /><br />By default if this field is not included at all it will be assumed as a **false** value and not included as part of the the initial configuration. If it is set to **true** it will be included and required to be configured.<br /><br />If defined as an object, you can give the `order` field a number value and prescribe the order of the overall configuration form flow. Additionally if the type of `initialConfig` is determined to be an object it will be assumed that this configuration should be inlcuded and required during the configuration flow.<br /><br />If you would like this configuration to be included, but optional (_skippable_) during the configuration flow, you must set the `required` field within that object to **false**.

`initialConfig` **Example**:

```yaml
initialConfig: true

# OR

initialConfig:
  order: 2
  required: false
```
