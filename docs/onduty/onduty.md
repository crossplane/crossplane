# Community On-Duty

Community on-duty is a weekly rotation of Crossplane community members who have
volunteered to help the Crossplane community. Volunteers are on-duty for a week
at a time. The goals of the on-duty rotation are to:

1. Ensure the Crossplane community feels heard and supported.
1. Prevent issues and pull requests (PRs) from falling through the cracks.
1. Make it easier for the next person on-duty to achieve the above goals.

Volunteers should be able to commit to focus on being on-duty for the majority
of their typical working day (e.g. ~7 hours a day). On-duty is expected to
respond to questions, issues and pull requests at their earliest convenience,
within 24 hours.

> Don't hesitate to reach out to the current person on-duty if you're interested
> in volunteering but can't commit to so much time - we may be able to work out
> smaller shifts.

When on-duty, you should:

* Make sure the title of #general in Crossplane Slack indicates that you are the
  person folks should ping with questions.
* Monitor Crossplane Slack - particularly #general and #dev - for questions from
  the community. Encourage folks to raise issues for more involved queries, bug
  reports, or feature requests.
* Monitor GitHub for new issues and PRs within the Crossplane org. Perform
  initial triage - e.g. thank the person for their contribution, update the PR
  or issue with any appropriate labels. Use your discretion as to whether you
  should attempt to address the issue or review the PR during your on-duty
  shift. On-duty is a great time to learn new things and address low hanging
  fruit, but you're not responsible for resolving everything that comes up
  during your shift.
* If there's a release happening during your on-duty week consider volunteering
  to run (or help with) the release.
* If there's a release happening the week after your on-duty week please take a
  pass over any open pull requests and ask the folks working on them whether
  they're release blockers and whether they expect to have them merged in time
  for a one week feature freeze before the release.

> You can use this [issues query] and this [PRs query] to quickly find new
> issues and PRs in the Crossplane GitHub org.

If it's a quiet on-duty week and the above isn't keeping you busy enough:

* Remember that part of on-duty is making life easier for the next community
  member on-duty. Is there something you can automate to make their life easier?
* Groom the issue and PR backlog. Close any that are obviously no longer
  relevant. Ask for updates on any that are stagnating.
* Look for low hanging improvements to community and contributor experience -
  e.g. improving documentation, improving tests and CI/CD.
