# Provision Infrastructure

Composite resources (XRs) are always cluster scoped - they exist outside of any
namespace. This allows an XR to represent infrastructure that might be consumed
from several different namespaces. This is often true for VPC networks - an
infrastructure operator may wish to define a VPC network XR and an SQL instance
XR, only the latter of which may be managed by application operators. The
application operators are restricted to their team's namespace, but their SQL
instances should all be attached to the VPC network that the infrastructure
operator manages. Crossplane enables scenarios like this  by allowing the
infrastructure operator to offer their application operators a _composite
resource claim_ (XRC). An XRC is a namespaced proxy for an XR; the schema of an
XRC is identical to that of its corresponding XR. When an application operator
creates an XRC, a corresponding backing XR is created automatically. This model
has similarities to [Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)]
in Kubernetes.

## Claim Your Infrastructure

The `Configuration` package we installed in the last section:

- Defines a `XPostgreSQLInstance` XR.
- Offers a `PostgreSQLInstance` claim (XRC) for said XR.
- Creates a `Composition` that can satisfy our XR.

This means that we can create a `PostgreSQLInstance` XRC in the `default`
namespace to provision a PostgreSQL instance and all the supporting
infrastructure (VPCs, firewall rules, resource groups, etc) that it may need!

After creating the `PostgreSQLInstance` Crossplane will begin provisioning a
database instance on your provider of choice. Once provisioning is complete, you
should see `READY: True` in the output when you run:

```console
kubectl get postgresqlinstance my-db
```

> Note: while waiting for the `PostgreSQLInstance` to become ready, you
> may want to look at other resources in your cluster. The following commands
> will allow you to view groups of Crossplane resources:
>
> - `kubectl get claim`: get all resources of all claim kinds, like `PostgreSQLInstance`.
> - `kubectl get composite`: get all resources that are of composite kind, like `XPostgreSQLInstance`.
> - `kubectl get managed`: get all resources that represent a unit of external
>   infrastructure.
> - `kubectl get <name-of-provider>`: get all resources related to `<provider>`.
> - `kubectl get crossplane`: get all resources related to Crossplane.

Try the following command to watch your provisioned resources become ready:

```console
kubectl get crossplane -l crossplane.io/claim-name=my-db
```

Once your `PostgreSQLInstance` is ready, you should see a `Secret` in the `default`
namespace named `db-conn` that contains keys that we defined in XRD. If they were
filled by the composition, then they should appear:

```console
$ kubectl describe secrets db-conn
Name:         db-conn
Namespace:    default
...

Type:  connection.crossplane.io/v1alpha1

Data
====
password:  27 bytes
port:      4 bytes
username:  25 bytes
endpoint:  45 bytes
```

## Consume Your Infrastructure

Because connection secrets are written as a Kubernetes `Secret` they can easily
be consumed by Kubernetes primitives. The most basic building block in
Kubernetes is the `Pod`. Let's define a `Pod` that will show that we are able to
connect to our newly provisioned database.

> Note that if you're using a hosted Crossplane you'll need to copy the db-conn
> connection secret over to your own Kubernetes cluster and run this pod there.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: see-db
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: see-db
    image: postgres:12
    command: ['psql']
    args: ['-c', 'SELECT current_database();']
    env:
    - name: PGDATABASE
      value: postgres
    - name: PGHOST
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-conn
          key: endpoint
    - name: PGUSER
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-conn
          key: username
    - name: PGPASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-conn
          key: password
    - name: PGPORT
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: db-conn
          key: port
```

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossplane/crossplane/master/docs/snippets/compose/pod.yaml
```

This `Pod` simply connects to a PostgreSQL database and prints its name, so you
should see the following output (or similar) after creating it if you run
`kubectl logs see-db`:

```SQL
 current_database
------------------
 postgres
(1 row)
```

## Clean Up

To clean up the `Pod`, run:

```console
kubectl delete pod see-db
```

To clean up the infrastructure that was provisioned, you can delete the
`PostgreSQLInstance` XRC:

```console
kubectl delete postgresqlinstance my-db
```

## Next Steps

Now you have seen how to provision and consume complex infrastructure via
composition. In the [next section] you will learn how compose and package your
own infrastructure APIs.
