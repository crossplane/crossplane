### Where did the name Crossplane come from?

Crossplane is the fusing of cross-cloud control plane. We wanted to use a noun
that refers to the entity responsible for connecting different cloud providers
and acts as control plane across them. Cross implies “cross-cloud” and “plane”
brings in “control plane”.

### What's up with popsicle?

We believe in a multi-flavor cloud.
