  # NOTE(negz): This is currently manually pushed. See README.md at
  # https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/function-dummy.
  # NOTE(negz): This version of the function uses meta.pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1
  # and is built with an old SDK that only serves v1beta1 RPCs. This is
  # intentional. We want to make sure Crossplane is backward compatible with
  # older v1beta1 functions.
