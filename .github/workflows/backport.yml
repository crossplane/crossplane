  # NOTE(negz): This is a risky target, but we run this action only when and if
  # a PR is closed, then filter down to specifically merged PRs. We also don't
  # invoke any scripts, etc from within the repo. I believe the fact that we'll
  # be able to review PRs before this runs makes this fairly safe.

  # NOTE(negz): I tested many backport GitHub actions before landing on this
  # one. Many do not support merge commits, or do not support pull requests with
  # more than one commit. This one does. It also handily links backport PRs with
  # new PRs, and provides commentary and instructions when it can't backport.
  # The main gotchas with this action are that it _only_ supports merge commits,
  # and that PRs _must_ be labelled before they're merged to trigger a backport.
