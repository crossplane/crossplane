- [ ] Prepared the release branch `release-X.Y` at the beginning of [Code Freeze]:
  - [ ] Created the release branch.
- [ ] Opened a [docs release issue].
- [ ] Run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] on the `release-X.Y` branch with the proper release version, `vX.Y.0`. Message suggested, but not required: `Release vX.Y.0`.
- [ ] Run the [CI workflow][ci-workflow] on the release branch and verified that the tagged build version exists on the [releases.crossplane.io] `build` channel, e.g. `build/release-X.Y/vX.Y.0/...` should contain all the relevant binaries.
- [ ] Run the [Configurations workflow][configurations-workflow] on the release branch and verified  that version exists on [xpkg.upbound.io] for all getting started packages.
  - [ ] `xp/getting-started-with-aws`
  - [ ] `xp/getting-started-with-aws-with-vpc`
  - [ ] `xp/getting-started-with-azure`
  - [ ] `xp/getting-started-with-gcp`
- [ ] Run the [Promote workflow][promote-workflow] with channel `stable` on the `release-X.Y` branch and verified that the tagged build version exists on the [releases.crossplane.io] `stable` channel at `stable/vX.Y.0/...`.
- [ ] Published a [new release] for the tagged version, with the same name as the version and descriptive release notes, taking care of generating the changes list selecting as "Previous tag" `vX.<Y-1>.0`, so the first of the releases for the previous minor.
- [ ] Checked that the [docs release issue] created previously has been completed.
- [ ] Updated, in a single PR, the following on `master`:
  - [ ] The [releases table] in the `README.md`, removing the now old unsupported release and adding the new one.
  - [ ] The `baseBranches` list in `.github/renovate.json5`, removing the now old unsupported release and adding the new one.
- [ ] Once the PR gets merged, run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] on the `master` branch with the release candidate tag for the next release `vX.Y+1.0-rc.0`.
- [ ] Updated the [`crossplane/test` repo test workflows][crossplane-test-workflows] to ensure the checkout release branch and helm install version(s) point at the new release across all the workflow files.
- [ ] Ensured that users have been notified of the release on all communication channels:
  - [ ] Slack: `#announcements` channel on Crossplane's Slack workspace.
  - [ ] Twitter: reach out to a Crossplane maintainer or steering committee member, see [OWNERS.md][owners].
- [ ] Request @jbw976 to remove the EOL docs version from Google Search
