## How to Contribute

The Build project is under [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE). We accept contributions via
GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions related to
development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other
resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a
Signed-off-by line to commit messages. For example:

```
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Git even has a -s command line option to append this automatically to your
commit message:

```
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you have already made a commit and forgot to include the sign-off, you can amend your last commit
to add the sign-off with the following command, which can then be force pushed.

```
git commit --amend -s
```

We use a [DCO bot](https://github.com/apps/dco) to enforce the DCO on each pull
request and branch commits.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the [install](INSTALL.md) for build and test instructions
- Play with the project, open issues, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
- Make your changes and arrange them in readable commits.
- Make sure your commit messages are clear about what changed and why.
- Make sure all tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
