# This file controls automatic PR reviewer assignment. See the following docs:

#
# The goal of this file is for most PRs to automatically and fairly have one
# maintainer and two reviewers set as PR reviewers. All maintainers have
# permission to approve and merge PRs, but reviewers do not. Most PRs should be
# reviewed by members of the reviewers group before being passed to a maintainer
# for final review.
#
# This in part depends on how the groups in this file are configured.
#
# @crossplane/steering-committee - Assigns 3 members. Admin perms to this repo.
# @crossplane/crossplane-maintainers - Assigns 1 member. Maintain perms to this repo.
# @crossplane/crossplane-reviewers - Assigns 2 members. Write perms to this repo.
#
# Where possible, prefer explicitly specifying a maintainer who is a subject
# matter expert for a particular part of the codebase rather than using the
# @crossplane/crossplane-maintainers group.

# See also OWNERS.md for governance details
