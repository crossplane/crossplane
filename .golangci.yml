    # Below are linters that lint for things we don't value. Each entry below
    # this line must have a comment explaining the rationale.

    # These linters add whitespace in an attempt to make code more readable.
    # This isn't a widely accepted Go best practice, and would be laborious to
    # apply to existing code.

    # Warns about uses of fmt.Sprintf that are less performant than alternatives
    # such as string concatenation. We value readability more than performance
    # unless performance is measured to be an issue.

    # This linter:
    #
    # 1. Requires errors.Is/errors.As to test equality.
    # 2. Requires all errors be wrapped with fmt.Errorf specifically.
    # 3. Disallows errors.New inline - requires package level errors.
    #
    # 1 is covered by other linters. 2 is covered by wrapcheck, which can also
    # handle our use of crossplane-runtime's errors package. 3 is more strict
    # than we need. Not every error needs to be tested for equality.

    # Enforces max line length. It's not idiomatic to enforce a strict limit on
    # line length in Go. We'd prefer to lint for things that often cause long
    # lines, like functions with too many parameters or long parameter names
    # that duplicate their types.
    - lll

    # Warns about struct instantiations that don't specify every field. Could be
    # useful in theory to catch fields that are accidentally omitted. Seems like
    # it would have many more false positives than useful catches, though.
    - exhaustruct

    # Warns about TODO comments. The rationale being they should be issues
    # instead. We're okay with using TODO to track minor cleanups for next time
    # we touch a particular file.
    - godox

    # Warns about duplicated code blocks within the same file. Could be useful
    # to prompt folks to think about whether code should be broken out into a
    # function, but generally we're less worried about DRY and fine with a
    # little copying. We don't want to give folks the impression that we require
    # every duplicated code block to be factored out into a function.
    - dupl

    # Warns about returning interfaces rather than concrete types. We do think
    # it's best to avoid returning interfaces where possible. However, at the
    # time of writing enabling this linter would only catch the (many) cases
    # where we must return an interface.
    - ireturn

    # Warns about returning named variables. We do think it's best to avoid
    # returning named variables where possible. However, at the time of writing
    # enabling this linter would only catch the (many) cases where returning
    # named variables is useful to document what the variables are. For example
    # we believe it makes sense to return (ready bool) rather than just (bool)
    # to communicate what the bool means.
    - nonamedreturns

    # Warns about using magic numbers. We do think it's best to avoid magic
    # numbers, but we should not be strict about it.
    - mnd

    # Warns about if err := Foo(); err != nil style error checks. Seems to go
    # against idiomatic Go programming, which encourages this approach - e.g.
    # to scope errors.
