# The MinimalAzure instance will be in the Kustomize resources for templating.
# Resource pack generic controller will use this template in another directory
# to create a final overlay for rendering. It will fill the missing runtime pieces such as name, namespace
# and uid of the MinimalAzure instance. Then it will refer to this `resources` folder.
#
# NOTE: `resources` array in this file will be overridden by the controller. Use
# kustomization.yaml file to list your resources.
