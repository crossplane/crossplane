# We need InfrastructurePublications to be deleted first because if two resources
# with pre-delete hooks have the same hook weight, they are deleted in alphabetic
# order. So, Helm tries to delete InfrastructureDefinitions but they cannot be
# deleted if they are published. Hence publications need to be deleted first.
