                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.
