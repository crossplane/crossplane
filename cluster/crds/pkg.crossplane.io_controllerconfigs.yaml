                    ephemeral:
                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.


                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.


                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                        volumeClaimTemplate:

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            mode, like fsGroup, and the result can be other mode bits set.
