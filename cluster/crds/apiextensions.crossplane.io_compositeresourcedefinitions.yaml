                              must be specified.


                              The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use
                              the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external
                              DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve
                              in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may
                              also be an IP address.


                              Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is
                              risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts
                              which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
                              webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy
                              to turn up in a new cluster.


                              The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".


                              A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in
                              a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the
                              webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.


                              Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
                              allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not

                  Versions is the list of all API versions of the defined composite
                  resource. Version names are used to compute the order in which served
                  versions are listed in API discovery. If the version string is
                  "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which
                  are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v",
                  then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the
                  string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These
                  are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no
                  suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then
                  minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2,
