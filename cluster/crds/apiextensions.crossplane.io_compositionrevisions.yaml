                description: WriteConnectionSecretsToNamespace specifies the namespace
                  in which the connection secrets of composite resource dynamically
                  provisioned using this composition will be created. This field is
                  planned to be removed in a future release in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsWithStoreConfigRef.
                  Currently, both could be set independently and connection details
                  would be published to both without affecting each other as long
                  as related fields at MR level specified.
