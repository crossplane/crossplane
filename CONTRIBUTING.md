Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to Crossplane. We encourage
you to help out by raising issues, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or
adding new features

If you're interested in contributing please start by reading this document. If
you have any questions at all, or don't know where to start, please reach out to
us on [Slack]. Please also take a look at our [code of conduct], which details
how contributors are expected to conduct themselves as part of the Crossplane
community.

## Contributing Code

To contribute bug fixes or features to Crossplane:

1. Communicate your intent.
1. Make your changes.
1. Test your changes.
1. Update documentation and examples where appropriate.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR).

Communicating your intent lets the Crossplane maintainers know that you intend
to contribute, and how. This sets you up for success - you can avoid duplicating
an effort that may already be underway, adding a feature that may be rejected,
or heading down a path that you would be steered away from at review time. The
best way to communicate your intent is via a detailed GitHub issue. Take a look
first to see if there's already an issue relating to the thing you'd like to
contribute. If there isn't, please raise a new one! Let us know what you'd like
to work on, and why. The Crossplane maintainers can't always triage new issues
immediately, but we encourage you to bring them to our attention via [Slack].

> NOTE: new features can only being merged during the active development period
> of a Crossplane release cycle. If implementation and review of a new feature
> cannot be accomplished prior to feature freeze, it may be bumped to the next
> release cycle. See the [Crossplane release cycle] documentation for more
> information.

Be sure to practice [good git commit hygiene] as you make your changes. All but
the smallest changes should be broken up into a few commits that tell a story.
Use your git commits to provide context for the folks who will review PR, and
the folks who will be spelunking the codebase in the months and years to come.
Ensure each of your commits is signed-off in compliance with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin] by using `git commit -s`. The Crossplane project highly
values readable, idiomatic Go code. Familiarise yourself with the
[Coding Style](#coding-style) section below and try to preempt any comments your
reviewers would otherwise leave. Run `make reviewable` to lint your change.

All Crossplane code must be covered by tests. Note that unlike many Kubernetes
projects Crossplane does not use Ginkgo tests and will request changes to any PR
that uses Ginkgo or any third party testing library, per the common Go [test
review comments]. Crossplane encourages the use of table driven unit tests - you
can find an example [below](#prefer-table-driven-tests). Note that when opening
a PR your reviewer will expect you to detail how you've tested your work. For
all but the smallest changes some manual testing is encouraged in addition to
unit tests.

All Crossplane documentation is under revision control; see the [docs] directory
of this repository. Any change that introduces new behaviour or changes existing
behaviour must include updates to any relevant documentation. Please keep
documentation changes in distinct commits.

Once your change is written, tested, and documented the final step is to have it
reviewed! You'll be presented with a template and a small checklist when you
open a PR. Please read the template and fill out the checklist. Please make all
requested changes in subsequent commits. This allows your reviewers to see what
has changed as you address their comments. Be mindful of  your commit history as
you do this - avoid commit messages like "Address review feedback" if possible.
If doing so is difficult a good alternative is to rewrite your commit history to
clean them up after your PR is approved but before it is merged.

In summary, please:

* Discuss your change in a GitHub issue before you start.
* Use your Git commit messages to communicate your intent to your reviewers.
* Sign-off on all Git commits by running `git commit -s`
* Add or update tests for all changes.
* Preempt [coding style](#coding-style) review comments.
* Update all relevant documentation.
* Don't force push to address review feedback. Your commits should tell a story.
* If necessary, tidy up your git commit history once your PR is approved.

Thank you for reading through our contributing guide! We appreciate you taking
the time to ensure your contributions are high quality and easy for our
community to review and accept. Please don't hesitate to [reach out to
us][Slack] if you have any questions about contributing!

## Coding Style

The Crossplane project prefers not to maintain its own style guide, but we do
enforce the style and best practices established by the Go project and its
community. This means contributors should:

* Follow the guidelines set out by the [Effective Go] document.
* Preempt common Go [code review comments] and [test review comments].
* Follow Crossplane's [Observability Developer Guide].

These coding style guidelines apply to all https://github.com/crossplane and
https://github.com/crossplane-contrib repositories unless stated otherwise.

Below we cover some of the feedback we most frequently leave on pull requests.
Most of these are covered by the documents above, but may be subtle or easily
missed and thus warrant closer attention.

### Explain 'nolint' Directives

We use [golangci-lint] on all our repositories to enforce many style and safety
rules that are not covered here. We prefer to tolerate false positives from our
linter configuration in order to make sure we catch as many issues as possible.
This means it's sometimes necessary to override the linter to make a build pass.

You can override the linter using a `//nolint` comment directive. When you do so
you must:

1. Be specific. Apply `//nolint:nameoflinter` at as tight a scope as possible.
1. Include a comment explaining why you're disabling the linter.

For example:

```go
func hash(s string) string {
        h := fnv.New32()
        _ = h.Write([]byte(s)) //nolint:errcheck // Writing to a hash never returns an error.
        return fmt.Sprintf("%x", h.Sum32())
}
```

Here we only disable the specific linter that would emit a warning (`errcheck`),
for the specific line where that warning would be emitted.

### Use Descriptive Variable Names Sparingly

Quoting the Go [code review comments]:

> Variable names in Go should be short rather than long. This is especially true
> for local variables with limited scope. Prefer `c` to `lineCount`. Prefer `i`
> to `sliceIndex`.
>
> The basic rule: the further from its declaration that a name is used, the more
> descriptive the name must be. For a method receiver, one or two letters is
> sufficient. Common variables such as loop indices and readers can be a single
> letter (`i`, `r`). More unusual things and global variables need more
> descriptive names.

Another way to frame the above is that we prefer to use short variables in all
cases where a (human) reader could easily infer what the variable was from its
source. For example:

```go

// NumberOfGeese might be used outside this package, or many many lines further
// down the file so it needs a descriptive name. It's also just an int, which
// doesn't give the reader much clue about what it's for.
const NumberOfGeese = 42

// w is plenty for the first argument here. Naming it gooseWrangler is redundant
// because readers can tell what it is from its type. looseGeese on the other
// hand warrants a descriptive name. It's short lived (lines wise), and its type
// doesn't give us any context about what it's for.
func capture(w goose.Wrangler, looseGeese int) error {
        // Important goose capturing logic.
        for looseGeese > 0 {
                // It's not obvious from the w.Wrangle method name what the
                // return value is, so a descriptive name names sense here too.
                captured, err := w.Wrangle()
                if err != nil {
                        return errors.Wrap(err, "defeated by geese")
                }
                looseGeese = looseGeese - captured
        }

        // We prefer 'y' to 'yard' here because 'yard' is implied by 'NewYard'.
        y := goose.NewYard(w)
        return y.Secure()
}
```

### Don't Wrap Function Signatures

Quoting again from the Go [code review comments]:

> Most of the time when people wrap lines "unnaturally" (in the middle of
> function calls or function declarations, more or less, say, though some
> exceptions are around), the wrapping would be unnecessary if they had a
> reasonable number of parameters and reasonably short variable names. Long
> lines seem to go with long names, and getting rid of the long names helps a
> lot.

```go
func capture(gooseWrangler goose.Wrangler, looseGeese int, gooseYard goose.Yard,
        duckWrangler duck.Wrangler, looseDucks, duckYard duck.Yard) error {
        // Important fowl wrangling logic.
}
```

If you find the need to wrap a function signature like the above it's almost
always a sign that your argument names are superfluously verbose, or that your
function is doing too much. If your function needs to take many optional
arguments, perhaps to enable dependency injection, use variadic functions as
options. In this case we usually make an exception for wrapped function calls.
For example:

```go
type Wrangler struct {
        fw fowl.Wrangler
        loose int
}

type Option func(w *Wrangler)

func WithFowlWrangler(fw fowl.Wrangler) Option {
        return func(w *Wrangler) {
                w.fw = fw
        }
}

func NewWrangler(looseGeese int, o ...Option) *Wrangler {
        w := &Wrangler{
                fw: fowl.DefaultWrangler{}
                loose: 
        }

        for _, fn := range o {
                fn(w)
        }

        return w
}

func example() {
        w := NewWrangler(42,
                WithFowlWrangler(chicken.NewWrangler()),
                WithSomeOtherOption(),
                WithYetAnotherOption())
        
        w.Wrangle()
}
```

You can read more about this pattern on [Dave Cheney's blog].

### Return Early

We prefer to return early. Another way to think about this is that we prefer to
handle terminal cases (e.g. errors) early. So for example instead of:

```go
func example() error {
        v := fetch()
        if v == 42 {
                // Really important business logic.
                b := embiggen(v)
                for k, v := range lookup(b) {
                        if v == true {
                                store(k)
                        } else {
                                remove(k)
                        }
                }
                return nil
        }
        return errors.New("v was a bad number")
}
```

We prefer:

```go
func example() error {
        v := fetch()
        if v != 42 {
                return errors.New("v was a bad number")
        }
        // Really important business logic.
        b := embiggen(v)
        for k, v := range lookup(b) {
                // "Continue early" is a variant of "return early".
                if v == false {
                        remove(k)
                        continue
                }
                store(k)
        }
        return nil
}
```

This approach gets error handling out of the way first, allowing the 'core' of
the function to follow at the scope of the function, not a conditional. Or put
otherwise, with the least amount of indentation. An interesting side effect of
this approach is that it's rare to find an `else` in Crossplane code (at the
time of writing there are four uses of `else` in `crossplane/crossplane`).
Quoting [Effective Go]:

> In the Go libraries, you'll find that when an if statement doesn't flow into
> the next statement—that is, the body ends in break, continue, goto, or
> return—the unnecessary else is omitted.

### Wrap Errors

Use [`crossplane-runtime/pkg/errors`] to wrap errors with context. This allows
us to emit logs and events with useful, specific errors that can be related to
deeper parts of the codebase without having to actually plumb loggers and event
sources deep down into the codebase. For example:

```go
import "github.com/crossplane/crossplane-runtime/pkg/errors"

func example() error {
        v, err := fetch()
        if err != nil {
                return errors.Wrap(err, "could not fetch the thing")
        }

        store(embiggen(v))
        return nil
}
```

### Scope Errors

Where possible, keep errors as narrowly scoped as possible. This avoids bugs
that can appear due to 'shadowed' errors, i.e. accidental re-use of an existing
`err` variable, as code is refactored over time. Keeping errors scoped to the
error handling conditional block can help protect against this. So for example
instead of:

```go
func example() error {
        err := enable()
        if err != nil {
                return errors.Wrap(err, "could not enable the thing")
        }

        // 'err' still exists here at the function scope.

        return errors.Wrap(emit(), "could not emit the thing")
}
```

We prefer:

```go
func example() error {
        if err := enable(); err != nil {
                // 'err' exists here inside the conditional block.
                return errors.Wrap(err, "could not enable the thing")
        }

        // 'err' does not exist here at the function scope. It's scoped to the
        // above conditional block.

        return errors.Wrap(emit(), "could not emit the thing")
}
```

Note that the 'return early' advice above trumps this rule - it's okay to
declare errors at the function scope if it lets you keep business logic less
nested. That is, instead of:

```go
func example() error {
        if v, err := fetch(); err != nil {
                return errors.Wrap(err, "could not enable the thing")
        } else {
                store(embiggen(v))
        }
        
        return nil
}
```

We prefer:

```go
func example() error {
        v, err := fetch()
        if err != nil {
                return errors.Wrap(err, "could not enable the thing")
        }

        store(embiggen(v))
        return nil
}
```

### Prefer Table Driven Tests

As mentioned in [Contributing Code](#contributing-code) Crossplane diverges from
common controller-runtime patterns in that it follows the advice laid out in the
Go project's [test review comments] documents. This means we prefer table driven
tests, and avoid test frameworks like Ginkgo. The most common form of Crossplane
test is as follows:

```go
// Example is the function we're testing.
func Example(ctx context.Context, input string) (int, error) {
        // ...
}

// Test function names are always PascalCase. No underscores.
func TestExample(t *testing.T) {
        type args struct {
                ctx   context.Context
                input string
        }

        type want struct {
                output int
                err    error
        }

        cases := map[string]struct{
                reason string
                args   args
                want   want
        }{
                // The summary is always PascalCase. No spaces, hyphens, or underscores.
                "BriefTestCaseSummary": {
                        reason: "A longer summary of what we're testing - printed if the test fails.",
                        args: args{
                                ctx: context.Background(),
                                input: "some input value",
                        }
                        want: want{
                                output: "the expected output",
                                err: nil,
                        }
                },
        }
        
        for name, tc := range cases {
                t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
                        got, err := Example(tc.args.ctx, tc.args.input)

                        // We prefer to use https://github.com/google/go-cmp/
                        // even for simple comparisons to keep test output
                        // consistent. Some Crossplane specific cmp options can
                        // be found in crossplane-runtime/pkg/test.
                        if diff := cmp.Diff(tc.want.err, err, test.EquateErrors()); diff != "" {
                                t.Errorf("%s\nExample(...): -want, +got:\n%s", tc.reason, diff)
                        }

                        if diff := cmp.Diff(tc.want.output, got); diff != "" {
                                t.Errorf("%s\nExample(...): -want, +got:\n%s", tc.reason, diff)
                        }
                })
        }
}
```

## Establishing a Development Environment

The Crossplane project consists of several repositories under the crossplane and
crossplane-contrib GitHub organisations. Most of these projects use the Upbound
[build submodule]; a library of common Makefiles. Establishing a development
environment typically requires:

1. Forking and cloning the repository you wish to work on.
1. Installing development dependencies.
1. Running `make` to establish the build submodule.

Run `make help` for information on the available Make targets. Useful targets
include:

* `make reviewable` - Run code generation, linters, and unit tests.
* `make e2e` - Run end-to-end tests.
* `make` - Build Crossplane.

Once you've built Crossplane you can deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster of your
choice. [`kind`] (Kubernetes in Docker) is a good choice for development. The
`kind.sh` script contains several utilities to deploy and run a development
build of Crossplane to `kind`:

```bash
# Build Crossplane locally.
make

# See what commands are available.
./cluster/local/kind.sh help

# Start a new kind cluster. Specifying KUBE_IMAGE is optional.
KUBE_IMAGE=kindest/node:v1.23.0 ./cluster/local/kind.sh up

# Use Helm to deploy the local build of Crossplane.
./cluster/local/kind.sh helm-install

# Use Helm to upgrade the local build of Crossplane.
./cluster/local/kind.sh helm-upgrade
```

When iterating rapidly on a change it can be faster to run Crossplane as a local
process, rather than as a pod deployed by Helm to your Kubernetes cluster. Use
Helm to install your local Crossplane build per the above instructions, then:

```bash
# Stop the Helm-deployed Crossplane pod.
kubectl -n crossplane-system scale deploy crossplane --replicas=0

# Run Crossplane locally; it should connect to your kind cluster if said cluster
# is your active kubectl context. You can also go run cmd/crossplane/main.go.
make run
```

## Code Review Process

All Pull Requests (PR), whether written by a Crossplane maintainer or a
community member, must go through code review. This ensures that the code is
correct, maintainable, and secure.

We encourage anyone in the community to conduct a code review on a PR,
however, we require the following approvals before merging a PR:
- At least one approval from [Reviewers] or [Code Owners]
- At least one approval from [Maintainers]

When opening a PR, GitHub will automatically assign the
[crossplane-reviewers] and [crossplane-maintainers] teams, as well as
any [Code Owners]. The PR author may also add any additional reviewers they
might want to have a look at the PR.

If the PR author has a specific code reviewer in mind, we encourage them to
remove the auto-assigned reviewers and directly add the individuals they would
like to review the code.

[Maintainers] will be the last to review a PR, after the initial review from
[Reviewers] and are the only ones that can merge a PR.

The PR author should notify the [crossplane-maintainers] team or the
individual maintainer assigned to the PR, when the PR is ready for their final
review.

### Reviewers vs Maintainers

[Reviewers] (or [Code Owners]) are there to ensure the code is functionally
correct, written according to the [Coding Style](#coding-style), and
sufficiently covered by tests. They take care of basic PR hygience by ensuring
the PR author has signed the DCO, and all CI jobs are passing before giving
their approval.

[Maintainers] will conduct a review focusing on ensuring APIs are
idiomatically aligned with the existing Crossplane codebase and does not steer
the project in the wrong direction.
