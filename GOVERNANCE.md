# Crossplane Governance

This document defines governance policies for the entire Crossplane project hosted and managed by
the [Crossplane organization](https://github.com/crossplane/).

## Steering Committee

Steering committee members demonstrate a strong commitment to the project with views in the interest
of the broader Crossplane community. They are the stewards of the entire Crossplane organization and
are expected to dedicate thoughtful and serious effort towards the goal of general success in the
ecosystem.

Responsibilities include:

* Own the overall charter, vision, and direction of the Crossplane project
* Promote broad adoption of the overall project, stewarding the growth and health of the entire
  community
* Provide guidance for the project maintainers
* Review and approve central/core architecture and design changes that have broad impact across
  multiple repositories
* Participate in the conflict resolution and voting process at the organization scope when necessary
* Approving new repositories, or archiving repositories in the Crossplane organization
* Add and remove members in the Crossplane organization
* Actively participate in the regularly scheduled steering committee meetings
* Regularly attend the recurring community meetings

The current list of steering committee members is published and updated in [OWNERS.md](OWNERS.md).
All steering committee members will be made owners of the Crossplane organization in GitHub.

### Bootstrapping the steering committee

The membership of the steering committee will go through an initial bootstrapping process to help
transition the stewardship and leadership of the community over a clearly defined time period and
process while ensuring that the project remains true to its initial charter.  It is essential that
the existing vision and strategy continues to guide the project while it continues to grow.
Therefore, transition in stewardship should not happen abruptly and the founding leadership should
not be diluted too quickly while the project is still being bootstrapped and transitioned.

Therefore, the membership will be bootstrapped over a **2 year period**, from the date of acceptance
of this governance, as follows:

* Membership will be **limited to 5** total seats
* **3 seats** are granted to the senior maintainers from the existing Crossplane governance: Bassam
    Tabbara, Jared Watts, and Nic Cope
  * **2 year** term
* **2 seats** to be filled by members of the community selected by the above committee members
  * **1 year** term
* When the term for a seat expires, the election process will be used to fill the seat with a
    replacement member with a **2 year** term

**After** the bootstrapping period of **2 years** has ended, the following membership rules will
become enacted:

* All terms are valid for **2 years**
* A single organization may have no more than **2 seats** on the committee

#### Updates During the Bootstrapping Period

We recognize that the bootstrapping period as defined above may not efficiently serve the needs of
the community as it experiences more growth and contributors, especially if that growth is rapid. It
is very difficult to forecast how the community will grow, but we do believe that the constraints of
the given bootstrapping period are a sufficient starting point.

We earnestly intend for the bootstrapping period to appropriately serve the needs of the community.
If the community expands in a manner that outgrows the limitations of the steering committee, then
we fully intend to make necessary changes, such as adding new seats to the committee in an
out-of-band process from the election schedule described in this governance.

The steering committee will have final say on when and how the committee is grown, but we intend for
it to be allowed to grow **if and when** the needs of the community require it. Any changes to the
bootstrapping period will require a **super majority** (at least **2/3** of votes) as described
in the [updating the governance](#updating-the-governance) section.

### Membership Qualifications

This section outlines the desired qualifications to become a member of the steering committee. Since
members will be selected through the election process after the initial bootstrapping, these
qualifications are meant to serve more as guidance and education than as rigid rules.

* Steering committee members in many cases will already be a maintainer on one or more of the
    repositories within the Crossplane project and be contributing consistently.
* While an existing repository maintainer position is helpful, a proposed member should have also
    demonstrated broad architectural influence and contributions across diverse areas of the
    project.
* The proposed member should have consistently exhibited input for the good of the entire project
    beyond the organization they are affiliated with and their input must have been aligned with the
    general charter and strategy and always with the big picture in mind.
* There is **no** minimum time period for contributions to the project by the proposed member.

### Election Process

#### Eligibility for Voting

Voting for steering committee members is open to all current steering committee members and
repository maintainers.

#### Nomination Criteria

* Each eligible voter can nominate up to 2 candidates
* Previous steering committee members are eligible to be nominated again
* An eligible voter can self-nominate
* Anyone can be nominated, they do **not** have to be an eligible voter
* The nominated candidate must accept the nomination in order to be included in the election
* Each nominated candidate must be endorsed by 2 eligible voters from 2 different organizations (the
    candidate can self-endorse if they are eligible to vote)

#### Election

Elections will be held using time-limited
[Condorcet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) ranking on
[CIVS](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) using the
[IRV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) method. The top vote getters will be
elected to the open seats.

#### Maximum Representation

As previously stated, when the bootstrapping period ends, the maximum number of steering committee
members from any organization will be limited to 2 in order to encourage diversity.

If the results of an election result in greater than 2 members from a single organization, the
lowest vote getters from that organization will be removed and replaced by the next highest vote
getters until maximum representation on the committee is restored.

If percentages shift because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, sufficient members of
the committee must resign until the maximum representation is restored. If it is impossible to find
sufficient members to resign, the entire company’s representation will be removed and new special
elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for example evaluating
independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all non-involved steering committee members
will decide.

#### Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of an elected steering committee member, the candidate
with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered the seat. This process will
continue until the seat is filled.

In case this fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will be held as soon as
possible. Eligible voters from the most recent election will vote in the special election (i.e.,
eligibility will not be redetermined at the time of the special election). A committee member
elected in a special election will serve out the remainder of the term for the person they are
replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

## Repository Governance

The Crossplane project consists of multiple repositories that are published and maintained as part
of the [Crossplane organization](https://github.com/crossplane) on Github. Each repository will be
subject to the same overall governance model, but will be allowed to have different teams of people
(“maintainers”) with permissions and access to the repository.  This increases diversity of
maintainership in the Crossplane organization, and also increases the velocity of code changes.

### Maintainers

Each repository in the Crossplane organization is allowed its own unique set of maintainers.
Maintainers have the most experience with the given repo and are expected to have the knowledge and
insight to lead its growth and improvement.

In general, adding and removing maintainers for a given repo is the responsibility of the existing
maintainer team for that repo and therefore does not require approval from the steering committee.
However, in rare cases, the steering committee can veto the addition of a new maintainer by
following the conflict resolution process below.

Responsibilities include:

* Strong commitment to the project
* Participate in design and technical discussions
* Participate in the conflict resolution and voting process at the repository scope when necessary
* Seek review and obtain approval from the steering committee when making a change to central
    architecture that will have broad impact across multiple repositories
* Contribute non-trivial pull requests
* Perform code reviews on other's pull requests
* Ensure that proposed changes to your repository adhere to the established standards, best
    practices, and guidelines, and that the overall quality and integrity of the code base is
    upheld.
* Add and remove maintainers to the repository as described below
* Approve and merge pull requests into the code base
* Regularly triage GitHub issues. The areas of specialization possibly listed in [OWNERS.md](OWNERS.md) can be
    used to help with routing an issue/question to the right person.
* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them
* Monitor Crossplane Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable), particularly for the area of
    your repository
* Regularly attend the recurring community meetings
* Periodically attend the recurring steering committee meetings to provide input
* In general continue to be willing to spend at least 25% of their time working on Crossplane (~1.25
    business days per week)

The current list of maintainers for each repository is published and updated in each repo’s
[OWNERS.md](OWNERS.md) file.

### Becoming a maintainer

To become a maintainer for a given repository, you need to demonstrate the following:

* Consistently be seen as a leader in the Crossplane community by fulfilling the maintainer
    responsibilities listed above to some degree.
* Domain expertise in the area of focus for the repository
* Willingness to contribute and provide value to all areas of the repository’s code base, beyond
    simply the direct interests of your organization, and to consistently promote the overall
    charter and vision of the entire Crossplane organization.
* Be extremely proficient with the languages, tools, and frameworks used in the repository
* Consistently demonstrate:
  * Ability to write good solid code and tests
  * Ability to collaborate with the team
  * Understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc.)
  * Understanding of the project's code base and coding style

Beyond your contributions to the project, consider:

* If your organization already has a maintainer on a given repository, more maintainers from your
    org may not be needed. A valid reason, however, is "blast radius" to get more coverage on a
    large repository.
* Becoming a maintainer generally means that you are going to be spending substantial time (>25%) on
    Crossplane for the foreseeable future.

If you are meeting these requirements, express interest to the repository’s existing maintainers
directly.

* We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog.
* As you gain experience with the code base and our standards, we will ask you to do code reviews
    for incoming PRs (i.e., all maintainers are expected to shoulder a proportional share of
    community reviews).
* After a period of approximately 2-3 months of working together and making sure we see eye to eye,
    the repository’s existing maintainers will confer and decide whether to grant maintainer status
    or not, as per the voting process described below. We make no guarantees on the length of time
    this will take, but 2-3 months is the approximate goal.
  * This time period is up to the discretion of the existing maintainer team and it is possible for
        new maintainers to be added in a shorter time period than this general guidance.

The existing maintainer team will then add the new maintainer to the repo’s [OWNERS.md](OWNERS.md) file, as well
as the appropriate GitHub team that allows maintainer permissions to the repo, including merging
pull requests into protected branches.

#### Maintainers for New Repositories

The guidelines of collaborating for 2-3 months may not be feasible for when a new repository is
being created in the Crossplane organization.  For new repositories, the steering committee can
choose to “bootstrap” the maintainer team as they see fit.

### Removing a maintainer

If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the maintainers per the voting process below.

## Organization Members

Beyond the roles of the steering committee and repository maintainers outlined above, contributors
from the community can also be added to the Crossplane organization as a “member”.  This affiliation
only comes with the base permissions (read-only) for the organization, so the requirements are
fairly low.  Adding new members has the following benefits:

* Encourages a sense of belonging to the community and encourages collaboration
* Promotes visibility of the project by being displayed on each member’s profile
* Demonstrated tangible growth of the community and adoption of the project
* Allows issues to be assigned to the user

When adding a new member to the organization, they should meet some of the following suggested
requirements, which are open to the discretion of the steering committee:

* Participated in the community in some tangible way, for example by:
  * opening issues
  * providing feedback on the project
  * engaging in discussions on issues, pull requests, Slack, etc.
  * attending community meetings
* Expressed interest in fixing issues and submitting pull requests of their own
* Evangelized and promoted Crossplane within the ecosystem

Community members that want to join the organization as a member should reach out directly to the
[steering committee members](OWNERS.md), via
any of the methods in the [README.md](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane#get-involved). New
members should be asked to set the visibility of their Crossplane organization membership to public.

## Updating the Governance

This governance will likely be a living document and its policies will therefore need to be updated
over time as the community grows.  The steering committee has full ownership of this governance and
only the committee may make updates to it. Changes can be made at any time, but a **super majority**
(at least **2/3** of votes) is required to approve any updates.

## Conflict resolution and voting

In general, it is preferred that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the leadership at the
appropriate scope can be called in to decide an issue. If that group cannot decide an issue
themselves, the issue will be resolved by voting.

### Issue Voting Scopes

Issues can be resolved or voted on at different scopes:

* **Repository**: When an issue or conflict only affects a single repository, then the **maintainer
    team** for that repository should resolve or vote on the issue.  This includes technical
    decisions as well as maintainer team membership.
* **Organization**: If an issue or conflict affects multiple repositories or the Crossplane
    organization and community at large, the **steering committee** should resolve or vote on the
    issue.

### Issue Voting Process

The issue voting process is usually a simple majority in which each entity within the voting scope
gets a single vote. The following decisions require a **super majority** (at least **2/3** of
votes), all other decisions and changes require only a simple majority:

* Updates to governance by the steering committee
* Additions and removals of maintainers by the repository’s current maintainer team
* Vetoes of maintainer additions by the steering committee

For organization scope voting, repository maintainers do not have a vote in this process, although
steering committee members should consider their input.

For formal votes, a specific statement of what is being voted on should be added to the relevant
GitHub issue or PR. Voting entities should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue or PR.

After a suitable period of time (goal is by 5 business days), the votes will be tallied and the
outcome noted. If any voting entities are unreachable during the voting period, postponing the
completion of the voting process should be considered.
