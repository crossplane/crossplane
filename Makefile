# Add "helm.sh/hook: crd-install" and "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy:
# before-hook-creation" annotations for clusterpackageinstalls and packageinstalls
# CRDs. Since Crossplane helm chart contains both CRD and ClusterPackageInstall
# CRs, helm fails to install both together. One option was to use
# `post-install,post-update` hooks in CR to deploy it after CRDs are installed,
# but this didn't work reliably with "helm upgrade --install" command. Using
# "crd-install" hook is already suggested in helm best practices doc:
# https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/#method-2-crd-install-hooks and we
# verified that it works reliably for all use cases. The other hook for deletion
# policy is necessary to be able to redeploy helm chart after it is deleted
# since CRDs with "crd-install" hooks will not be deleted with "helm delete" and
# cause next "helm install" to fail.
# "helm.sh/hook: crd-install" was deprecated in helm3 and CRDs with this annotation are
# skipped. This results in the PackageInstall and ClusterPackageInstall CRDs not being
# installed in helm3 when they have that annotation.
# As a workaround, we first copy those CRDs under <chart>/crds directory which
# was introduced with helm3 and ignored in helm2, then afterwards apply the annotation to
# those CRDs under <chart>/templates/crds for helm2.
