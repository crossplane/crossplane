Crossplane can be extended using packages. Crossplane packages are called xpkgs.
Crossplane supports configuration, provider and function packages.

A package is an opinionated OCI image that contains everything needed to extend
a Crossplane control plane with new functionality. For example installing a
provider package extends Crossplane with support for new kinds of managed
resource (MR).

See https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/packages for more information.
