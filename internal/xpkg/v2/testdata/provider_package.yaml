                      CREATING: Resolver is creating and configuring one or more Amazon
                      VPC    network interfaces for this endpoint. \n    * OPERATIONAL:
                      The Amazon VPC network interfaces for this endpoint are    correctly
                      configured and able to pass inbound or outbound DNS queries
                      \   between your network and Resolver. \n    * UPDATING: Resolver
                      is associating or disassociating one or more network    interfaces
                      with this endpoint. \n    * AUTO_RECOVERING: Resolver is trying
                      to recover one or more of the network    interfaces that are
                      associated with this endpoint. During the recovery    process,
                      the endpoint functions with limited capacity because of the
                      limit    on the number of DNS queries per IP address (per network
                      interface). For    the current limit, see Limits on Route 53
                      Resolver (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html#limits-api-entities-resolver).
                      \n    * ACTION_NEEDED: This endpoint is unhealthy, and Resolver
                      can't automatically    recover it. To resolve the problem, we
                      recommend that you check each IP    address that you associated
                      with the endpoint. For each IP address that    isn't available,
                      add another IP address and then delete the IP address    that
                      isn't available. (An endpoint must always include at least two
                      IP    addresses.) A status of ACTION_NEEDED can have a variety
                      of causes. Here    are two common causes: One or more of the
                      network interfaces that are    associated with the endpoint
                      were deleted using Amazon VPC. The network    interface couldn't
                      be created for some reason that's outside the control    of
                      Resolver. \n    * DELETING: Resolver is deleting this endpoint
                      and the associated network    interfaces."
